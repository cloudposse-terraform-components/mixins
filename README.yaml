# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This is a collection of Terraform mixins are drop in files intended to be used with multiple components.

usage: |-
  Typically this is not a component you will use directly but will instead vendor in particular files for a given component.
  
  e.g.
  ```yaml
  
  apiVersion: atmos/v1
  kind: ComponentVendorConfig
  spec:
      # ...
      mixins:
      - uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/mixins/{{ .Version }}/src/mixins/github-actions-iam-role/github-actions-iam-role.mixin.tf
        version: v0.1.0
        filename: github-actions-iam-role.mixin.tf
  ```
  or the full yaml file
  ```yaml
  # 'ecr' component vendoring config
  
  # 'component.yaml' in the component folder is processed by the 'atmos' commands
  # 'atmos vendor pull -c ecr' or 'atmos vendor pull --component ecr'
  
  apiVersion: atmos/v1
  kind: ComponentVendorConfig
  spec:
    source:
      # 'uri' supports all protocols (local files, Git, Mercurial, HTTP, HTTPS, Amazon S3, Google GCP),
      # and all URL and archive formats as described in https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter
      # In 'uri', Golang templates are supported  https://pkg.go.dev/text/template
      # If 'version' is provided, '{{ .Version }}' will be replaced with the 'version' value before pulling the files from 'uri'
      uri: github.com/cloudposse-terraform-components/aws-ecr.git//src?ref={{ .Version }}
      version: v1.538.0
      # Only include the files that match the 'included_paths' patterns
      # If 'included_paths' is not specified, all files will be matched except those that match the patterns from 'excluded_paths'
      # 'included_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported)
      # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)
      # https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar#patterns
      included_paths:
        - "**/**"
      # Exclude the files that match any of the 'excluded_paths' patterns
      # Note that we are excluding 'context.tf' since a newer version of it will be downloaded using 'mixins'
      # 'excluded_paths' support POSIX-style Globs for file names/paths (double-star `**` is supported)
      excluded_paths: []
    # Mixins override files from 'source' with the same 'filename' (e.g. 'context.tf' will override 'context.tf' from the 'source')
    # All mixins are processed in the order they are declared in the list.
